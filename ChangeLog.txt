1.3.0
	Thanks to github user @nick-odell for this update to 1.10.1:
		Working in 1.10.1
			Fixed a bunch of bugs with the timeline / keyframes
			Added button to reset manipulations for a keyframe to default (technically the original state when the editor was opened)
			When saving custom animations, the backup system now works properly, and keeps up to 5 backups.
			Loading animations now has a file selection UI, and adding common mixing transforms has been made easier
			Can now animate the kerbal's base position (for things like jumps or dances)
			Player now supports kerbal-specific animation choices, and enabling/disabling kerbals for when using shift. (Defaults to the standard global behavior at launch however)
			Player module can be activated on external IVA kerbals, and specific IVA kerbals can be animated using the kerbal-specific animations
			Other various UI and UX additions / improvements
		Known Issues:
			Due to the differences between male and female kerbals, animations will have some deviations when used on models other than the one they were made for originally
			The new EVA models for the expansions were not addressed (I don't have them installed)
	Added additional toggle to window to switch between the stock KSP skin and the alternate (Unity) skin.
